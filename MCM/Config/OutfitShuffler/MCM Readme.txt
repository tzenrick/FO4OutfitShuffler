### Uninstall
This option clears the formlists and stops the OutfitShuffler Control Quest. It DOES NOT RESET OUTFITS and requires a reinstall.

### Restart from OnInit()
This option restarts the mod from OnInit. It attempts to reset all formlists and reload all data. 95% of this is accomplished in "Rescan Outfits" and should be used as a last result before removing the mod, loading the game without the mod, saving the game without the mod, and reinstalling the mod.
