Changelog:
	7.3 Lots of cleaning, speed improvements, logging improvements (Disable if you don't need it. Seriously.) Much better Devious Devices/Real Handcuffs compatibility.

	7.2 Container management is much cleaner now. It's SUPPOSED to ignore the container used by Dave's In-Game ESP Explorer, now. I added rudimentary Devious Devices Support. I also added in a NoNudes option. It should be more aggressive at keeping some sort of clothing on the NPC's, unless they've been hit with the DontChange keyword. ** It is advised by the authors, and other users, that Devious Devices and NPCs don't mix well. I tried.

	7.1 Now adds random amounts of random items to containers when you're looting. You rummage around in there, and sometimes something turns up.

	7.0 BodyGen options now include a "BodyGen OneShot" option, that will only regenerate the NPCs once, then flag them to not change, even if their outfit does. Hotkey is available to change NPCs even if the other BodyGen options are disabled.
	[Races] and [FactionsToIgnore] in the OufitShuffler.ini, now accept regular hexadecimal values. 0x123456 <== Is the correct format to use.
	MCM Readme.txt is in Data\MCM\Config\OutfitShuffler\ in the 7z, and in the root of the repo at https://github.com/tzenrick/FO4OutfitShuffler/blob/main/MCM%20Readme.txt

	6.9 Nice. Huge Speed and Stability improvements.
	There was an accidental soft-dependency on AAF in previous versions. It would have caused extra outfit changes on some NPCs. Talos II Exosuits are now properly protected.

	6.8 Fixed the pesky issue that was removing clothing from everyone...I think.

	6.7 Outfit INI files now accept standard hexadecimal, so no more converting.

	6.6 Cleaned up most of the outfit 'flicker.' (When two items keep replacing each other.)

	6.5 Lots of code cleanup, much cleaner/more readable debugging. Optimization for speed.

	6.3 BodyGen and Scale can be randomized with outfit changes, with a hotkey, or just disabled.

	6.2 Some of the updates are pretty big...

	6.23 Added more Vtaw Outfits

	6.21 Just outfit sets. Don't bother unless you're adding Classy Chassis outfits to your collection.

	6.22 Changed directory structure to hopefully make it MO2 friendly.
